# Code Refractor on Website

## Description 

The task that I was given was to make a HTML and CSS codes from a "marketing agency" to follow website accessibility standards. The client wants their website to be optimized for serach engines.They requested that their codes meet the following criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    1. WHEN I view the source code, THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    3. WHEN I view the image elements, THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    4. WHEN I view the heading attributes, THEN they fall in sequential order
    5. WHEN I view the title element, THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In this project, I learned the techniques of code refractor. I revamped the HTML tags to use semantic HTML and updated the CSS file. I also resolved the issue with links and including alternate text to images for accessibility.
